    <h1>Missional Life - Marking Out Your Story</h1>
    <h2>Alpha Project Session #3: Nathaniel Lightle</h2>

    <p>Marking out your story is helpful for two main points:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Understanding God's work in your life</li>
        <li>Telling others about God through your story</li>
    </ol>

    <p>For the first point, we used the following worksheet to go through our own lives to see how God has and is and will continue to work in our lives.</p>

    <p>Marking out our story glorifies God:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>thoughtful, intentional, honest reflection</li>
        <li>where we used to be</li>
        <li>where we are now</li>
        <li>don't want to forget the goodness of God in our lives</li>
    </ul>

    <p>One example of God's faithfulness can be found in Exodus. God saved the Israelites out of slavery, but in the wilderness, they forget God and abandon Him. Despite their many times failing and rejecting God, He has mercy, provides for, and leads them to the Promised Land. This story is evident through Moses:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Genesis was written anonymously, but both Jewish and Christian religious tradition attributes the entire Pentateuch—Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy— to Moses."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Marking out your story points you back that ultimately, the story is about God.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The God of the universe is worth knowing.</li>
        <li>He reveals himself to us in His work and in His word.</li>
        <li>The more we know of Him the more we are irresistibly drawn to Him.</li>
    </ul>
