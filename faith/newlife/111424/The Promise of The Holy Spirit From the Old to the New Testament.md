## Matthew 28:20  
Jesus concludes the Great Commission with His promise: "I am with you always, to the very end of the age." This is not just a promise—it is a fact. All of God's promises, as reflected in Scripture, are absolute truths.

## Old Testament Promise  
- In **Acts 1:5**, Jesus commands the apostles not to leave Jerusalem but to wait for the "promise of the Father"—a reference to the coming of the Holy Spirit.  
- The **Spirit in the Old Testament**:  
  - The Spirit actively worked in the lives of Old Testament saints. This challenges the misconception that the Spirit was absent or inactive before Pentecost.  
  - Examples in **Romans 4**:  
    - **Abraham**: A Gentile, justified by faith before the law.  
    - **David**: A Jew, forgiven through grace. Both illustrate justification by faith, not by works.  
  - The Spirit was given "drop by drop" to select individuals like prophets, kings, and priests.  

- **Eschatological Fullness**:  
  - The Old Testament prophets foresaw a day when the Spirit would be poured out abundantly. This future outpouring was linked to the end times and God's plan to restore creation.  
  - Francis Turretin described this as moving from a sparing to an overwhelming abundance of the Spirit in the New Testament era.  
  - **Geerhardus Vos**: The Spirit and resurrection are inseparably linked. Without the Spirit, there is no resurrection; without resurrection, there is no Spirit.

## The Valley of Dry Bones (Ezekiel 37)  
- **Ezekiel 37:5-14**:  
  - The Spirit (ruach) brings life to lifeless bones, symbolizing the restoration of Israel and the hope of resurrection.  
  - This vision reflects Israel's despair during exile: "Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost."  
  - God promises to open graves, raise His people, and place His Spirit within them—a clear foreshadowing of resurrection life in Christ.

---

## Isaiah 32:15  
- The Spirit's outpouring will transform the wilderness into a fruitful land, a metaphor for the reversal of the curse and the ushering in of the new creation.  
- **Revelation 22**: Trees bearing fruit along the river echo the restoration of Eden, now in its eternal, glorified form. The goal of the garden was always the new creation in glory.

---

## Joel 2:28-29  
- A prophecy that the Spirit would be poured out on all people: sons, daughters, old, young, servants, and free.  
- Contrasts with the Old Testament, where the Spirit was limited to specific roles (e.g., prophets, priests, kings).  
- Alludes to Moses’ wish in **Numbers 11:29**: "Would that all the Lord's people were prophets, that the Lord would put His Spirit upon them!"

## Fulfillment in the New Testament

### Acts 2:33  
- Jesus, exalted at the right hand of the Father, receives the Spirit and pours it out on the church.  
- This marks His **coronation** as the victorious King, fulfilling Old Testament promises like **Psalm 68**.

### John 7:38-39  
- Jesus speaks of rivers of living water flowing from Him, symbolizing the Spirit's future abundance.  
- Connects to **Ezekiel 47**, where life-giving water flows from the temple, showing Jesus as the ultimate temple.

### John 20:22  
- Jesus breathes on His disciples, a symbolic act foreshadowing Pentecost. **D.A. Carson** sees this as an assurance of the Spirit they would fully receive later.

## Pentecost (Acts 2)  
### Three Signs of the Spirit's Outpouring  
1. **Wind**: Represents the life-giving power of the Spirit (cf. Ezekiel 37).  
2. **Fire**: Signifies purification and God's consuming holiness (cf. Luke 3:16, Exodus 3).  
3. **Tongues**: Reverses Babel by enabling the proclamation of God's mighty works in every language (cf. Genesis 11).  

- The Spirit empowers believers to proclaim the gospel, fulfilling **Acts 1:8**.  
- **Prophesying in Acts 2**: Declaring the mighty works of God, demonstrating the fulfillment of Joel's prophecy.

## Conclusion  
- The Spirit cleanses, regenerates, and empowers God's people, transforming them into a new creation.  
- Pentecost marks the breaking in of the end times: the future age of glory begins in the present, but its full consummation awaits Christ's return.  
- All God's promises, including the promise of the Spirit, find their "Yes" in Christ (2 Corinthians 1:20).
