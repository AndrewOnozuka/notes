    <h2>Subheading</h2>
    Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
    And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done.
    So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation.
    These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.
    When no bush of the field was yet in the land and no small plant of the field had yet sprung up - for the Lord God had not caused it to rain on the land, and there was no man to work the ground,
    and a mist was going up from the kabd as was watering the whole face of the ground -
    then the Lord God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature.
    And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed.
