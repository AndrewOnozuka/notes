\homework{2}{Spring 2024}{Jishen Zhao} {May 10, 2024}{(42 points)}

\subsection*{Instructions}
\begin{itemize}
\item The homework must be submitted to Gradescope by 11:59pm. { Anything later is a late submission}
\item Handwritten or typed responses are accepted. 
\item All responses must be neat and legible. Illegible answers will result in zero points.
\item Provide details on how to reach a solution. An answer without explanation gets no credit. Clearly state all assumptions.



\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Branch Prediction (8 points)}\\
Assume the following instruction mix for a 5-stage MIPS pipeline:
\begin{center}
  \begin{table}[h]
  \centering
\begin{tabular}{ |l|l|}
\hline
Instruction &	Proportion \\ \hline
Load & 20\% \\ \hline
Store & 15\%  \\ \hline 
Arithmetic	& 35\%  \\ \hline
Branch & 30\%  \\\hline
Total & 100\% \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{center}
The processorâ€™s base CPI = 1. The branch is always predicted as not taken.  55\% of the branches are taken.  50\% of the load instructions are immediately followed by an instruction that uses the loaded value. There are no other stalls in the pipeline.  Branch misprediction has a 4 cycle penalty. Stalling due to a load instruction has a 2 cycle overhead. Calculate the CPI of this pipeline.

\item \textbf{Pipelining(15 points)} 

Assume the following program is running on the 5-stage in-order pipeline processor shown in class. All registers are initialized to 0. Assuming only WX(WP0) and WD (register file internal forwarding) forwarding, branches are resolved in \textbf{Decode} stage, and branches are always predicted \textbf{not-taken}. How many cycles will it take to execute the program, if the branch outcome is \textbf{actually taken}? Draw a pipeline diagram (table) to show the details of your work. Use arrows to indicate forwarding.
\begin{verbatim}
       lw $r6 0($r10) 
       lw $r7 0($r11) 
       add $r2 $r6 $r7 
       beq $r2 $r3 label 
       sub $r6 $r8 $r4 
       sw $r6 0($r10) 
 label:lw $r1 0($r2) 
       or $r4 $r2 $r1
       mul $r5 $r4 $r9

\end{verbatim}
\item \textbf{MIPS ISA(10 points)}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Write the MIPS instructions for the code given below. The values of u,v,x and y need to be in R5, R6, R7 and R8 registers respectively at the end of the code.( Note: Consider R0 as the zero register)(4 points).
    \clearpage
        u=1 \\
        v=1\\
        x = u+v\\
        y = 1+x\\
        x = y-u\\
        u = x \\
        v = y \\
        \\
    \item What are the potential hazards that would occur in the above question if no stalls were present. Explain why it would be a hazard with pipeline diagram?(6 points)
  \end{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Critical Path(9 points)}\\
  For these problems, consider the figure of the datapath , and the given table which shows the delay of micro-architectural components in the datapath. Calculate the time it takes to execute the following instructions. You may assume that the delay of anything not mentioned in the table (including wires and ALU control) is zero.

    \begin{center}
    \begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{ |l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Unit &	Instruction Memory & Register Read/Write & ALU & Data Memory & Mux & Add & Control Unit \\ \hline
Delay(ps) & 290 & 140 & 180 & 290 & 50 & 70 & 140    \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Load Word ( e.g., lw \$t1, 8(\$t0) ) 
    \item  Store ( e.g., store \$t0, 12(\$t1) ) 
    \item And ( e.g., and \$t2, \$t0, \$t1 ) 
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
