Why Everywhere?

The movement of missions is at the heart of God. 
Acts 1:3-9

The love of God is in the heart of His people.
Acts 2:42-43

2 Corinthians 5:14-15

The Gospel is the truth, and therefore it is true for all men. It is the unveiling of the face of Him who makes all things, from whom every man comes, and to whom every man goes. It is the revealing of the meaning of human history, of the origin and destiny of mankind. Jesus is not only my Savior, He is the Lord of all things, the cause and cornerstone of the universe. If I believe that, then to bear witness to that is the very stuff of existence. If I think I can keep it to myself, then I do not in any real sense believe it. Foreign missions are not an extra; they are the acid test of whether or not the Church believes the Gospel. - Lesslie Newbigin

We often think, “Once I’m empowered by the Spirit, then I’ll go on mission.” But the truth is, when you step out on mission, you’ll realize the Spirit has already empowered you. Without mission, Christianity loses its sense of purpose, becoming stale and boring.

Missions helps remind you of your mission.
