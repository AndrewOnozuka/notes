    <h1>Communical Life - Crucial Accountability</h1>
    <h2>Alpha Project Session #13: Berkeley Gomez</h2>

    <p>What is a crucial conversation?</p>
    <img src="img/cruc_convo.png" alt="Crucial Conversation">

    <p>There is a false dichotomy that says we can only choose one:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>We can tell the truth</li>
        <li>We can keep a friend</li>
    </ol>
    <p>but in fact, we can tell the truth, hold others accountable to their commitments, AND strengthen the relationship.</p>

    <h3>WHAT and IF</h3>
    <p>We first need to determine:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>WHAT</strong> convo needs to happen</li>
        <p>What actually needs to be discussed? What’s the main issue here?</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Unbundle – separate the various issues
                <ul>
                    <li>Content – the first time an issue comes up</li>
                    <li>Pattern – not the first time an issue has come up</li>
                    <li>Relationship – an issue is impacting our relationship</li>
                    <li>The issue could also be HOW you’re communicating. Are you too direct? Not direct enough?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Choose – ask “what do I really want?”</li>
            <li>Simplify – state simply what you want to discuss</li>
        </ol>
        <li><strong>IF</strong> this convo needs to happen</li>
        <p>Determine if this convo needs to happen:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Am I acting out my concerns? (sarcastic, harsh, dismissive)</li>
            <li>Is my conscience nagging me?</li>
            <li>Am I choosing the certainty of silence over the risk of speaking up?</li>
            <li>Am I telling myself I’m helpless?</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <h3>How we think communication happens</h3>
    <img src="img/expect.png" alt="Expected Communication">

    <h3>In reality, we tell ourselves stories</h3>
    <img src="img/tell_a_story.png" alt="Telling a Story">

    <h3>What story am I telling myself?</h3>
    <p>Work backwards:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Am I acting out my concerns rather than talking them out? (act)</li>
        <li>What emotions are encouraging me to act this way? (feel)</li>
        <li>What story is creating these emotions? (tell story)</li>
        <li>What have I seen or heard that supports or conflicts with this story? (see/hear)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to craft a better story</h3>
    <p>Be honest about yourself and give them the benefit of the doubt:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What am I pretending not to notice about <strong>my</strong> role in the problem?</li>
        <li>Why would a <strong>reasonable, rational, and decent</strong> person do what this person is doing?</li>
        <li>What do I really want for me, for others, and for the relationship?</li>
        <li>What should I do right now to move toward what I really want?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to have the convo</h3>
    <p>STATE your path:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>S</strong>hare your facts</li>
        <li><strong>T</strong>ell your story</li>
        <li><strong>A</strong>sk for their path</li>
        <li><strong>T</strong>alk tentatively</li>
        <li><strong>E</strong>ncourage testing</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As you listen, remember:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ask (express interest in their views)</li>
        <li>Mirror (acknowledge their emotions)</li>
        <li>Paraphrase (restate what you’ve heard them say)</li>
        <li>Prime (if they’re holding back, take your best guess at what they’re thinking or feeling)</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
        <i>In my distress I called upon the Lord; to my God I cried for help. From his temple he <strong>heard</strong> my voice, and my cry to him <strong>reached</strong> his ears.</i>
        <strong><cite>Psalm 18:6</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Overall</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Start with safety (compassion, calm, respect)</li>
        <li>Share your path (what I perceive happened)</li>
        <li>End with a question: “From your perspective, what happened?”</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
        <i>The Lord is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth.</i>
        <strong><cite>Psalm 145:18</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>What does Jesus say?</h3>
    <p>*We can initiate because God initiated with us in Christ.*</p>

    <blockquote>
        <i>but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</i>
        <strong><cite>Romans 5:8</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Matthew 18 principles:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Keep the circle small. "If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone".</li>
        <li>Be straightforward. "Tell him his fault."</li>
        <li>Be Forgiving. "If he hears you, you have gained your brother." This implies that once the matter is resolved, we should whole-heartedly forgive and restore the person whose fault has offended us.</li>
    </ol>
