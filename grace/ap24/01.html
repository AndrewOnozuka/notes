    <h1>All of Life Rally - Hebrews 12</h1>
    <h2>Alpha Project Session #1: Noah Lee</h2>

    <p>We addressed two main questions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Is the Gospel Good?</b></li>
        <li><b>Is the Gospel Beautiful?</b></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Noah made an analogy of our time in Alpha Project with a hyperbolic time chamber from Dragon Ball Z (image below). The point? We have the opportunity of a concentrated time at AP where we can be cultivated, train, and grow our faith before going back into the real world.</p>

    <p>We then moved onto 3 guiding questions regarding our AP theme, Living Mosaics (<strong><cite>Hebrews 12</cite></strong>):</p>
    
    <strong>1. What is the Mosaic?</strong>
    <p>Definition: "a combination of diverse elements forming a more or less coherent whole" - we are the pieces of the mosaic that come together to form one unified family under God.</p>
    <p>God's promise is like a parlay, where the parlays are all the heroes of faith outlined in <strong><cite>Luke 3:23-38</cite></strong>, who are all pieces of the mosaic. This convicted me to go back into the genealogy and really study it.</p>
  
    <strong>2. Why is the Mosaic Living?</strong>
    <blockquote>
        <i>For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.</i>
        <strong><cite>Hebrews 4:12</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The "race" spoken of in <strong><cite>Hebrews 12</cite></strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>requires endurance</li>
        <li>will have obstacles that slow us down</li>
        <li>is run with a team</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Noah then talked about the Olympic Torch Relay (image below) and how it is over 3,100 miles, over 61 days, and passed through over 10,000+ people. The journey of the Olympic torch from Athens to Paris 2024 mirrors that of our race that bridges from Redemption to New Creation, after we have received the torch from the Heroes of the Faith who passed it down from the Fall to Redemption.</p>

    <strong>3. What makes the Mosaic beautiful?</strong>
    <blockquote>
        <i>looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.</i>
        <strong><cite>Hebrews 12:2</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>
    <p>"We were saved from the <strong>penalty</strong> of sin, we are being saved from the <strong>power</strong> of sin, and we will be saved from the <strong>presence</strong> of sin." - Jeff Vanderstelt</p>
    <blockquote>
        <i><sup>3</sup>And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. <sup>4</sup>He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”</i>
        <strong><cite>Revelation 21:3-4</cite></strong>
