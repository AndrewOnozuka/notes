# Life Skills - Finding Your Calling
## Alpha Project Session #9: Ella Lentz

Based off of the book *Garden City* by John Mark Comer.

God & JMC both say that we are made to work!

Your calling isn't something you choose, but something only you unearth.

Your calling is what God made you to do uniquely.

Much of finding your calling is about finding out:
- who you are
- what you <u>alone</u> can contribute to the world
