    <h1>Missional Life - Heart for the Nations</h1>
    <h2>Alpha Project Session #22: Pastor Joel Yoon</h2>

    <h3>Why do we do missions? Where does it tell us in the Bible to do missions?</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <i><sup>1</sup>Now the Lord said to Abram, “Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you. <sup>2</sup>And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. <sup>3</sup>I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”</i>
        <strong><cite><u>Genesis 12:1-3</u></cite></strong>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The Bible doesn't just have a few verses about missions, the Bible <strong><u>itself</u></strong> is about missions. And the Bible itself is <strong><u>missional</u></strong>. God is on a <strong><u>mission</u></strong> to redeem the <strong><u>world</u></strong> through the <strong><u>church</u></strong> by the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>

    <h3>We used to walk with God and everything was <strong><u>good</u></strong></h3>

    <blockquote>
        <i>And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.</i>
        <strong><cite><u>Genesis 1:31</u></cite></strong>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <i>And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day</i>

    <h3><u>Missions</u> is the Grace</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <i><sup>1</sup>Now the LORD said to Abram, “Go from your country and your kindred and your father's house to the land that I will show you. <sup>2</sup>And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. <sup>3</sup>I will bless those who bless you, and him who dishonors you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”</i>

    <ul>
        <li>The <strong><u>reason</u></strong> for missions is <strong>blessings</strong></li>
        <li>The <strong><u>hope</u></strong> for missions is <strong>God</strong></li>
        <li>The <strong><u>means</u></strong> for missions is <strong>our names</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Rest of the Old Testament, Jesus & The Church</h3>
    <p>You are now a <strong><u>part</u></strong> and the <strong><u>means</u></strong> of this story of <strong><u>redemption</u></strong>.</p>

    <h3>Heaven</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <i><sup>7</sup>After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands, <sup>10</sup>and crying out with a loud voice, “Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!” <sup>11</sup>And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, <sup>12</sup>saying, “Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God forever and ever! Amen.”</i>
        <strong><cite>Revelation 7:9-12</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Big Idea</h3>
    <p><strong>Missions is not <u>extra</u></strong></p>
    <blockquote>
        <i>"The Gospel is the truth, and therefore it is true for all men. It is the unveiling of the face of Him who makes all things, from whom every man comes, and to whom every man goes. It is the revealing of the meaning of human history, of the origin and destiny of mankind. Jesus is not only my Savior, He is the Lord of all things, the cause and cornerstone of the universe. If I believe that, then to bear witness to that is the very stuff of existence. If I think I can keep it to myself then I do not in any real sense believe it. Foreign missions are not an extra; they are the acid test of whether or not the Church believes the Gospel."</i>
        <strong><cite>Lesslie Newbigin</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Missions is the <u>endgame</u></strong></p>
    <blockquote>
        <i>"All true vitality in the work of missions depends in the last analysis upon the secret springs of supernatural life which they know who give time to communion with God. All true witness to Christ is the overflowing of a reality too great to be contained. It has its source in a life of adoration and intercession... Any real power that God may give them will come through those secret channels which are in this age, as in every age, the true means of blessing for the world."</i>
