    <h1>Leaders Life - Growth Mindset 2.0</h1>
    <h2>Alpha Project Session #10: Sea Choi</h2>

    <h3>Growth Mindset:</h3>
    <p>The belief that your abilities or your potential in some domain can change, under the right conditions and right support.</p>

    <h4>What holds people back from a growth mindset?</h4>
    <h3>Fixed Mindset:</h3>
    <p>You believe your abilities, talents, intelligence or personality traits are given and unchangeable.</p>

    <h4>Cognitive Dissonance</h4>
    <p>Discomfort a person feels when their behavior does not align with their values or beliefs</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Feelings of guilt</li>
        <li>Shame or embarrassment</li>
        <li>Justification or rationalization</li>
        <li>Doing something out of social pressure over true interest</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Changing our mindset to a new narrative:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Challenges</li>
        <li>Stress</li>
        <li>Identity</li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote>
        <i>I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</i>
        <strong><cite>Galatians 2:20</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <i>And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.</i>
        <strong><cite>Philippians 1:6</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>“Remember to Surrender”</h3>
    <p>Redefine the “stress” moments we experience as an opportunity to remember to surrender; to give your entire dependence to Christ. Your life depends on it.</p>

    <h3>The Discipline of Staying Down</h3>

    <h3>Discussion Questions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>When’s a time you’ve experienced having a growth mindset?</li>
        <li>What’s an area of your life you have a “fixed-mindset” attitude toward?</li>
        <li>How can you look to Jesus to present a new narrative in that area of your life?</li>
    </ol>
