    <h1>All of Life Rally - Hebrews 11</h1>
    <h2>Alpha Project Session #17: Berkeley Gomez</h2>

    <h3>Seeing the Unseen</h3>
    <p>"Seeing is believing" – have you ever heard that? In the Western world, we are trained to ignore the supernatural. Historically, humans have assumed the reality of the spiritual realm. Outside the Western world today, there is still a strong awareness of the supernatural. The Enlightenment produced the dominant rational view in the West that only what is experienced with our bodily senses is “real.” But in order to live the life Christ calls us to, the high level of sacrifice and denial that it requires to be a true follower of Jesus, you can’t base what you believe solely on what you can see. You need to have spiritual senses. You need faith.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <i><sup>1</sup>Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. <sup>2</sup>For by it the people of old received their commendation. <sup>3</sup>By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible.</i>
        <strong><cite>Hebrews 11:1-3</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>

    <p>What is godly faith? It is a trust in God and His promises that leads to obedience.</p>
    <p>Faith can be seen to incorporate both <strong>trust</strong> in the promises of God, as well as <strong>faithfulness</strong> to God when tested by difficult situations.</p>
    <p><strong>Endurance</strong>, then, is also an attribute of faith lived in the real world.</p>
    <p>Faith, rather than being something ultimately dependent <strong>upon</strong> us, comes <strong>to</strong> us at God’s own initiative which engenders a hope-filled response to the promises of God.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <i>For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not from you; it is the gift of God; it is not from works, so no one may boast.</i>
        <strong><cite>Ephesians 2:8-9</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Abraham</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <i><sup>8</sup>By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going. <sup>9</sup>By faith he went to live in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him of the same promise. <sup>10</sup>For he was looking forward to the city that has foundations, whose designer and builder is God.</i>
        <strong><cite>Hebrews 11:8-10</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Abraham lived by faith. He did not know where he was going but took God at his word. He had a very real experience with the unseen in Genesis 12 where God told him to go to “a land I will show you.” Abraham had trust in God that led to faithfulness in obeying God’s command.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <i><sup>2</sup>And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. <sup>3</sup>And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. <sup>4</sup>He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.” <sup>5</sup>And he who was seated on the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things new.” Also he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.” <sup>6</sup>And he said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment.</i>
        <strong><cite>Revelation 21:2-6</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Moses</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <i><sup>24</sup>By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, <sup>25</sup>choosing rather to be mistreated with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. <sup>26</sup>He considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward. <sup>27</sup>By faith he left Egypt, not being afraid of the anger of the king, for he endured as seeing him who is invisible.</i>
        <strong><cite>Hebrews 11:24-27</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Moses was adopted by Pharaoh’s daughter and had every earthly comfort. But when he saw how his people were being mistreated, he couldn’t ignore it. He ended up having to flee Egypt and years later, when God called him back to Egypt to help rescue the Hebrew people, he hesitantly stepped out in faith.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <i><sup>3</sup>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, <sup>4</sup>even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love <sup>5</sup>he predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will, <sup>6</sup>to the praise of his glorious grace, with which he has blessed us in the Beloved. <sup>7</sup>In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, <sup>8</sup>which he lavished upon us, in all wisdom and insight.</i>
        <strong><cite>Ephesians 1:3-8</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <i><sup>13</sup>In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, <sup>14</sup>who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory.</i>
        <strong><cite>Ephesians 1:13-14</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Rahab</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <i>By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had given a friendly welcome to the spies.</i>
        <strong><cite>Hebrews 11:31</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Rahab heard of the greatness of God and feared him more than man. She lied to protect the Israelite spies and ended up living with the Israelites, becoming the great-great-grandmother of King David.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <i><sup>10</sup>Then she fell on her face, bowing to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your eyes, that you should take notice of me, since I am a foreigner?” <sup>11</sup>But Boaz answered her, “All that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband has been fully told to me, and how you left your father and mother and your native land and came to a people that you did not know before. <sup>12</sup>The Lord repay you for what you have done, and a full reward be given you by the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge!”</i>
        <strong><cite>Ruth 2:10-12</cite></strong>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Endurance in Faith</h3>
    <p>Towards the end of the chapter, we see a contrast between those who conquered and saw miracles and deliverance with those who suffered, died, and didn’t see the promises of God fulfilled. Was God more faithful to one than the other? How can we still trust God when we’re in group B and not in group A?</p>

    <h3>Jesus is the Ultimate Example</h3>
    <p>Who is the ultimate example of a life lived by faith? And the only way we can live by faith ourselves? Jesus. That’s who all of these people listed in Hebrews 11 looked towards and that’s who we look to as well.</p>
    <p>Jesus didn’t have earthly stability, he depended on others’ hospitality as he traveled and did ministry. He didn’t enjoy earthly rewards even though many times people wanted to make him king. But he “chose to be mistreated” because he was looking to another reward. And he was ultimately rejected, crucified and didn’t have a sense of belonging even to his own earthly family who didn’t believe in him while he was on earth. He gets it. And he did all this out of obedience to His Father and his love for us.</p>
    <p>If circumstances go the way we want or not, we look to Jesus. The one who went before us, is with us, will always be our advocate before the Father.</p>
    <p>In the next chapter, Hebrews 12:2 tells us to live our lives by continuously “fixing our eyes on Jesus”. But where is Jesus now? We can’t see him now because he is seated at the right hand of the throne of God. This verse wouldn’t make sense if “fixing the eyes on” refers to physical sight. The reference is to spiritual sight. Every Christian is called to a persevering faith that constantly looks to Jesus who had persevering faith.</p>
    <p>We are called to see the unseen and live by life-changing faith.</p>
