# Review of Romans 1-4, Introduction to Romans 5:1-11

Jesus does enough to show that He is sent from God, but does not always make it clear? fix wording tmr

Son of Man, not Son of God - Jesus hid his identity as the final heavenly prophet, who came to bring the final persecution. Old Testament prophets were __ persecutors.

Jesus speaks in parables and people don't understand - 

When Pontius Pilate asks if Jesus is King and the crowd says "Caesar is the only king we recognize", it represents the ultimte denouncement of God's Lordship over Israel, bringing an end to the old covenant and marking the beginning of the new covenant.

Jesus says not everyone will understand. 

The Gospel is both the power and righteousness of God. We think of grace, but Paul introduces the gospel as the righteousness. This righteousness is a double edged sword - prosecuting the Jews and Gentiles on the basis of the revelation of God's righteousness. 

Even though the gentiles don't have God's law, when they do things that are according to God's law, it shows that they have somewhat of an understanding of God's law - which makes it possible for them to face persecution?

Deathless/Immortal Life vs Eternal Life

Eternal life: to be in communion with God forever in the heavenly life

Grace in the court of law is an abomidable concept. As much as we love grace, as those in a pitiful condition, in a court of law, justice has to prevail. No need to be ashamed of the Gospel because it is a revelation of God's righteousness. If you get presidential pardon, you may escape from the punishment but you cannot escape the shame.


If you are saved by grace alone, you cannot say you are ashamed of the Gospel. If the shame follows you after salvation, 


God cannot abandon grace to save us. 

dealing with the issue of being a righteous God while also giving grace to a sinner (someone who doesn't deserve it).

maladiction opposite of benediction?

gotta listen again


self maladictory oath - 


as a Holy God, He cannot keep the promise without being cursed like the animals??

fulfills justice and righteousness


the messianic figure would prevail, but has to suffer

idea of righteous grace

grace by saving sinners while upholding righteousness

God justifies sinners in Christ - in order to uphold the justice of God, Jesus paid the ultimate cost by dying on the cross while living a perfect life

double imputation 
def: Protestant theological doctrine that involves the imputation of sin to Jesus and the imputation of Christ's righteousness to believers. It's a key part of the gospel and is closely related to the Reformed doctrine of justification by grace through faith alone.
- when Jesus died, he takes our dirty clothes, and gives us His robe of righteousness

Justification/Condemnation - this is what a judge is supposed to do

1 tim 3:16

we don't individually receive justification, we are justified in Christ


"by" causal vs instrumental

faith does not forgive you, Jesus forgives you

if we are dirty as sinners, Jesus's blood is the water that cleanses us. faith is the faucet with which we receive the water, but it is ultimately the water (Jesus) that cleanses us.

we are saved by the works of Christ. Christ has to work

covenant of life vs covenant of redemption

both are covenant of works because obedience is required for the reward

covenant of grace is not free. Jesus *earned* our salvation and that is what is freely given by grace.

If we confess our sins, he is **faithful** and **just** to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
*1 John 1:9*

Because Jesus paid the penalty of our sin, if God is just He cannot punish the same crime twice.

that is why we can freely receive justification

gen 16:5 Abrahamâ€™s justification and circumcision 

abram vs abraham -> made into a father of nations, justified by faith alone without circumcision so he can be the father of gentiles, circumsized later to also be the father of jews - shows centrality of faith for justification

when we sin, not only do we sin against God's law, but also against His grace
