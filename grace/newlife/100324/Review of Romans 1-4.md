Romans was written by Paul as he planned to stop by Rome on the way to Spain.

Jesus did enough to show that He was sent from God, but did not always make it explicitly clear. He often left His identity somewhat hidden, especially during His ministry.

Jesus referred to Himself as the "Son of Man" rather than the "Son of God" because He was intentionally hiding His identity as the final heavenly prophet, the one who came to bring the final prosecution against Israel. The Old Testament prophets were covenant prosecutors, sent to call Israel to repentance by confronting them with their violations of God's covenant.

Jesus often spoke in parables, which people did not always understand, fulfilling the role of a prophet who brought both revelation and judgment.

When Pontius Pilate asked if Jesus was King and the crowd responded with, "Caesar is the only king we recognize," it represented the ultimate denouncement of God's lordship over Israel, bringing an end to the old covenant and marking the beginning of the new covenant.

Jesus made it clear that not everyone would understand His message. His teachings were meant to reveal truth to some while concealing it from others.

The Gospel is both the power and righteousness of God. While we often think of grace, Paul introduces the gospel in Romans as the righteousness of God. This righteousness is a double-edged sword, used to prosecute both Jews and Gentiles on the basis of God's revealed righteousness.

Even though the Gentiles did not have the Mosaic Law, when they acted according to God's law, it revealed that they had some understanding of it, making them accountable to God's judgment.

### Deathless/Immortal Life vs Eternal Life

Immortal life is life without death, which Adam had before the Fall. Eternal life is the life promised by God, lived in full communion with Him in heaven.

Grace in a court of law is an abominable concept because, as much as we love grace, justice must prevail in the courtroom. There is no need to be ashamed of the Gospel because it reveals God's righteousness. If you receive a presidential pardon, you may escape punishment, but you cannot escape the shame of your crime.

If you are saved by grace alone, you cannot say that you are ashamed of the Gospel. If shame follows you after salvation, it contradicts the complete work of justification.

God cannot abandon righteousness to save us. He remains just while also extending grace to sinners, which leads to the question of how God can be righteous while giving grace to those who don’t deserve it.

### Maladiction

Maladiction is the opposite of benediction. Maladiction means to curse, while benediction means to bless.

God made a self-maledictory oath: as a holy God, He could not keep His promise without bearing the curse on Himself. This was symbolized in Genesis 15 when God, in the form of a flaming torch, passed through the pieces of animals, taking on the curse for breaking the covenant, even though He would never fail to keep it.

This act fulfills both justice and righteousness. God upholds His righteousness by taking the curse that should have fallen on sinners.

The Messianic figure (Jesus) would prevail, but had to suffer in the process, fulfilling the prophecy of the suffering servant.

### Righteous Grace

God's grace is not arbitrary; it is grounded in His righteousness. He saves sinners while upholding justice.

God justifies sinners in Christ—not by abandoning justice but by fulfilling it through Jesus' sacrificial death and perfect life.

### Double Imputation

This is a key Protestant theological doctrine. Our sins are imputed (credited) to Jesus, and His righteousness is imputed to us. When Jesus died, He took on our "dirty clothes" (sin) and gave us His "robe of righteousness" (perfect righteousness).

### Justification/Condemnation

These are judicial acts of God. Justification is God declaring a sinner righteous, while condemnation is God declaring someone guilty.

1 Timothy 3:16 refers to Jesus being justified—meaning declared righteous—through His resurrection, not that He became the Son of God at that point.

We don’t individually receive justification; we are justified in Christ. His justification becomes ours through faith.

"By" can be understood causally or instrumentally. Faith does not cause forgiveness—Jesus forgives. Faith is the instrument through which we receive Jesus' work.

If we are dirty as sinners, Jesus' blood is the water that cleanses us. Faith is the faucet through which we receive the water, but ultimately, it is Jesus who cleanses us.

We are saved by the works of Christ, not by our own works. Christ had to live and die for our salvation.

### Covenant of Life vs Covenant of Redemption

Both are covenants of works because obedience is required for the reward.

The Covenant of Grace is not free in the sense that it cost Jesus His life. Jesus earned our salvation through His perfect obedience, and that is what is freely given to us by grace.

1 John 1:9: "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." Jesus’ payment for our sin means that God, being just, cannot punish the same sin twice. This is why we can freely receive justification.

Genesis 16:5 speaks of Abraham’s justification and circumcision. Abraham was justified by faith before circumcision, making him the father of Gentiles who are justified by faith alone. His circumcision later made him the father of Jews, showing that justification is through faith, not circumcision.

When we sin, we not only violate God's law, but we also sin against His grace.
