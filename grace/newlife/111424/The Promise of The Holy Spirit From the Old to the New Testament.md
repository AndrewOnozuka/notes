and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.” Matthew 28:20

All of God's promises are facts.

Old Testament Promise
"[Jesus] ordered [the apostles] not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father." Acts 1:5 (ESV)

Romans Ch. 4 Paul talks about Justification by Faith

two examples: Abraham and David
outsider gentile vs insider Jew to show how we are justified by faith

people in the old testament were saved through the spirit

there was just a promise of something greater to come in the new.

sends prophets with a promise of God's

talking about an end point with the spirit

in the end time, escatalogical (end day) that the prophets were pointing the Israelites to where 

"[The spirit was given] more sparingly [in the OT] and to fewer persons, and as it were, drop by drop (...) [the Spirit] flows in great abundance [in the NT] and like a river inundates the whole church." Francis Turretin, Elentic Theology


Revelation 21 and 22 were all things that were sinful were done away with

You can't have the spirit without the ressurection. 

called the "hope of Israel" in Acts 28:20

"The Spirit and the resurrection belong together." Geerhardus Vos (1862-1949)

"Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are indeed cut off." Ezekiel 37:11b

"until the Spirit is poured upon us from on high,  
    and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field,  
    and the fruitful field is deemed a forest." Isaiah 32:15

Revelation 22 has trees that bear fruit alongside the river

The original sinless garden of eden was designed with the end of an eternal glorified 


The goal of the garden was the new creation in glory.

In Eden, the Garden of God

Ezekiel 14, ??

"...lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life [the one found in Rev. 22] and live forever [in sin]." Genesis 1:22

Galatians fruit of the spirit

"I will cause breath [the Hebrew being ruach, li. Spirit] to enter you, and you shall live." Ezekiel 37:5

Through the Spirit, these bones are raised to life.

"And I looked, and behold, there were sinews on them, and flesh had come upon them, and skin had covered them. But there was no breath in them." Ezekiel 37:8

"So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great army." Ezekiel 37:10

"Behold, I will open your graves and raise you from your graves, O my people... and I will put my Spirit within you, and you shall live" Ezekiel 37:12, 14

"I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules." Ezekiel 36:25-27

The Spirit cleanses the , and then enables obedience.

"it shall come to pass afterward,  
    that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh;  
your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,  
    your old men shall dream dreams,  
    and your young men shall see visions.  
Even on the male and female servants  
    in those days I will pour out my Spirit." Joel 2:28-29
    
male and female, servants, everyone will spirit this spirit, although in the old testament it was only kings, prophets, and priests who were able to receive this Spirit and the power was given to all. alludes to Numbers 11:29: 

"Would that all the Lord's people were prophets, that the Lord would put his Spirit on them!" Numbers 11:29

"For all the promises of God find their Yes in him. That is why it is through him that we utter our Amen to God for his glory." 2 Corinthians 1:20

all of God's promises find their yes in Christ. not some, but all.

Jesus received the Holy Spirit first.

Acts 2:33

didn't Jesus already possess the Spirit? why did He only receive the Spirit after He ascended? The Spirit was involved in the virgin birth. The Spirit was His from the very beginning as He grew, the dove was the Spirit at His baptism. The Spirit empowers Him when He begins His ministry. The Spirit of God anointed Him. 

"In Acts 2, Jesus is the resurrected king who received the promised Holy Spirit as proof of his victory [in his death and resurrection] and subsequently pours out the Spirit." Brandon Crowe, The Hope of Israel

Acts 2:33 is the coronation of Jesus as king after he defeats sin. He pours out what he receives.

John 14:18 Jesus promises his disciples not to leave them as orphans.

John 16:7

John 7:38-39 out of "his" heart could be ours or Christ, Dr. Briones believes it is that of Christ. Water into wine, Samaritan Woman and living water, then in John 7, 'Out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.'

In John 2 Jesus

Jesus was talking about the 

Jesus and John as a temple, Jesus offering water, all points to the great promise in the old testament. It will not be drop by drop but a river that inundates.

John 20:22 - Jesus has not ascended yet, but gives the Holy Spirit. This is an acted out parable (according to DA Carson). They are guaranteed to receive the Holy Spirit but it isn't until Acts 2, the pentecost.

Acts 2:9-11 all types of people, every tongue, tribe, nation. Acts 2:2-4

Acts 2:15 third hour = 9am

Acts 2:17 - doesn't appear in Joel but Peter includes: "in the last days", this was seen as in the last day, the Spirit would be poured out.

The future promise is breaking into the present. 

The 3 signs in Acts 2:
1. the mighty wind of God (v2) the spirit making its appearance and filling the entire house - connects to Ezekiel's vision of wind
2. tongues of purifying fire (v3) connects to Luke 3:16
3. tongues of the nations (v4) Acts 2:4,8 - reversal of the tower of babel, in the person of Christ by believing in Him and being saved

prophesy in acts 2 is declaring the mighty acts of God. These three signs show how the promises in the old testament are being fulfilled 

definitive forgiveness, cleanes us, shows us Christ, glorified Christ, unites us to Christ.
