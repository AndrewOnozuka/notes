Addressing this contradiction: how can we retain our belief in God and the Word of God when there is such a blatant contradiction?

A lot of people have a very simplistic approach to both God and the Bible. The Bible contains a lot of “seeming” contradictions. They are often not real contradictions but appear to be. Depending on the angle with which you perceive something, you’ll see different things. For example a cylinder can be both a circle or a rectangle at the same time. Maybe the reason why we have four gospels is so it provides us a more clear picture of the gospel of Jesus. 

Important to consider that a lot of contradictions are caused due to the relationship between the Old Testament and the New Testament. There is a progression within God’s Word. There is something old about the OT and there is something new about the NT, yet the Bible proclaims itself as continuous.

In the OT, you couldn’t eat pork belly for example. But in Acts 10:15, it says not to call anything impure that God has made clean.

The Bible is not just instructions and theological statements, it is ultimately a history. It isn’t a recording of what happened randomly, but rather a recording of what God accomplished in history for our redemption. It is historically progressive but also organically united. There is a pattern of promise/prophecy and fulfillment. These patterns are not always literal, and vary from types (earthly) to antitypes (heavenly). 

Joshua leading the people to the promised land is described as a type of Jesus Christ. Joshua is the type and Jesus is the antitype, Jesus is the greater Joshua. Christ is the translation of the Hebrew word Messiah Jesus is the transliteration of the Hebrew word Joshua. Discussion on the difference of translation and transliteration, yet Jesus Christ combines both in the name. It shows the old and new dynamic. OT Jesus and NT Christ, as in Christ everyone else was saved. Jesus is the true lamb of God. Types are limited because they are earthly representations of the heavenly reality. By participating in trusting in God’s provision for a more perfect sacrifice such as David in Psalm 51, we get a taste of the heavenly reality. God wants you not to rely on the blood of bulls and goats, but the understanding that no amount of bloodshed can bring true forgiveness of sin and looking to God as the only source.

In Luke 9, there is an account of Jesus’s transfiguration. The word for departure is literally “exodus” - referring to the death of Jesus Christ.

The nature of the Bible is not literal, it is literary.
Literal: taking words in their primary sense without metaphor or allegory
Literary: relating to literature, which utilizes

The Bible does not just consist of laws and commandments (usually literal) but also consists of multi-faceted modes of God’s communication

Proverbs is a part of wisdom literature, not commandments and laws. Commandments and laws are black and white, but the Bible is not always black and white. There are certain things that the Bible does not say is right or wrong such as alcohol; these are matters of indifference. Wisdom is choosing good over evil. It is choosing between different options that are not necessarily bad. Difficult decisions are not between right and wrong, but between both good options. There is no ethical right or wrong between choosing school or jobs, for example. Applicable for me right now as someone who is strongly considering defense.

These two statements in Proverbs 26:4-5 would be contradictory if they were laws. However these are not laws. If you read Psalms like they are laws, there will be lots of contradictions. Different genres of the Bible require different interpretations. Solomon is supposed to be one of the wisest people; surely there was a purpose for these seemingly contradictory statements beyond ignorance.

There are different ways of communicating: 
Didactic vs Socratic/dialectic

Wisdom requires a lot of thought, trial and error. Wisdom is hard, it is something you have to grow in. It is not obvious from the beginning. The juxtaposition of these two verses can communicate different ways of dealing with a fool, not right or wrong. Depending on what? Does anything matter?

God maybe doesn’t care about which choice you choose, but rather why we choose the things that we choose. If we want to grow as Christians, we need to wrestle with these things. It’s about doing the right thing with the right motive and the right perspective, not just doing the right thing.

Jesus the wisdom of God (1 Cor. 1:24)

The physical reality is not the ultimate reality as it lacks the spiritual reality. When you come to know Jesus Christ, you come to know the full reality. Only then can you begin to gain true wisdom. Without knowing Him, we cannot have true wisdom at all.
